# Bank Transfer Management System with NestJS
This challenge is an application developed with NestJS that provides a basic CRUD for bank account management. It allows creating, deleting, updating, and retrieving bank accounts, as well as obtaining a list of all created accounts.

## Components
- Service: Performs CRUD operations on bank transfers and communicates with the database.
- Controller: Generates endpoints to access the API for managing bank transfers.
- DTO: Data Transfer Objects for receiving transfer information and returning transfer details.
- Entity: Represents the core data structure for a bank transfer.

## Repository Installation:
Clone this repository to your local machine to access the challenge files, using the following command:

```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/jhonfabernorena/challengeNest
```

## Execution
1. Open the terminal, either manually by selecting 'Terminal > New Terminal' or by using the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + Ã‘.
2. Run the project using the command:
```bash
npm run start:dev 
```

### API requests
These requests will allow you to interact with the system to perform various operations in the API, such as querying an account by its ID, viewing all accounts, deleting accounts, among others.

As an alternative, you will be able to access each of the queries through Postman, where you will have the opportunity to interact with the program efficiently.
